                Ridwan is first a human being, then every other thing amazing. Professionally, he's a content writer and strategist. Unprofessionally, he's a trained microbiologist (shh! Don't tell anyone). He enjoys good food. Lots of it, actually. He loves soaking up nature in his spare time. And he'd like to travel more.</p>
